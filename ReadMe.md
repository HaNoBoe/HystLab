## Introduction
HystLab is a MATLAB based software for advanced processing and analysis of magnetic hysteresis data.  HystLab is an easy to use graphical interface that is compatible with a wide range of software platforms.

If users encounter bugs or problems using HystLab, or have any suggestions for improving the software, we would really like to hear from as all input is welcome. If you use HystLab in your work, please make it clear what version was used and what data processing was performed.
We would also be grateful if you cited the publication that introduced HystLab: Paterson, G. A., X. Zhao, M. Jackson, and D. Heslop (2018), Measuring, processing, and analyzing hysteresis data, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst., 19, doi:[10.1029/2018GC007620](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GC007620).

Details on how to use HystLab are provided in the instruction manual packaged with HystLab.
